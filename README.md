# Guess My Number
 
This is a game that allows a user to try and guess a random #. If the user enters a # that is too high or too low, the browser will let them know to lead them in the right direction. If the user enters in the wrong #, the score will continue to decrease until the right # is chosen. Upon winning the game, if the user's score is great than the current highscore, the highscore will be updated. The user is able to reset a game with the Again! button.
